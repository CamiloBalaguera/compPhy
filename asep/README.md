## Simulating the ASEP (asymmetric simple exclusion process)
Exclusion processes refer to a family of models of transport where particles have hard-core interaction. A randomly chosen particle on a 1D lattice will move to its neighbouring site if it is empty. These models can be studied under different kind of boundary conditions. We will only be concerned with open chain exclusion process where particles are injected from the left boundary at a rate  α1  and are absorbed at the right boundary at rate  β1 .

If a randomly chosen particle can hop to right and left with same probability, then the process is called symmetric exclusion process. Usually, the rates of movement to left and right are different and hence the model is generally called ASEP. We will be concerned mainly with what is called totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs) where the rate of movement to the left is zero while particles move to right with a rate 1, given that the next site is empty (exclusion). We consider the following two cases:

#### One lane
A randomly chosen particle on a 1D lattice will move to its neighbouring site if it is empty with a rate 1. 

#### Two lanes
The above one lane model can be studied with two parallel lanes. Here the rate of hopping to a neighbouring empty site is affected by the occupancy of the other lane. There is no inter-lane hopping in this model.
