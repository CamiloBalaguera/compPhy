## Simulating the ASEP (asymmetric simple exclusion process)
Exclusion processes refer to a family of models of transport where particles have hard-core interaction.


##Single lane
A randomly chosen particle on a 1D lattice will move to its neighbouring site if it is empty. These models can be studied under different kind of boundary conditions. We will only be concerned with open chain exclusion process where particles are injected from the left boundary at a given rate and are absorbed at the right boundary at another rate.

##Double lane
The same model can be studied with two parallel lanes. Here, we will not consider the case without particle exchange between the lanes. These lanes affect the dynamics indirectly by tuning the transition rate on the respective lattices. T
