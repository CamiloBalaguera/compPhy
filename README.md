##compPhy

This is the repository for codes written on miscellaneous topic in physics. 

Ising model is simulated. Code to simulate asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is also included. It is useful to think of ASEP as the Ising model of Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics. Thus, this repository contains code to simulate Ising models! We also have a class of codes for random walk. 

Also, included is a collection of notebooks which includes example python codes of miscellaneous topics in physics. 
Comments and feedbacks are welcome.
