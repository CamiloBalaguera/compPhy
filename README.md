compPhy: Models of computational physics in python [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rajeshrinet/compPhy/master?filepath=notebooks)
========


This repository has an assortment of codes for model systems in physics. 
In particular, some representative models of statistical physics are included.
For example,

* Simulation of the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm 

* Monte Carlo simulation of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) 

* Python notebooks on miscellaneous topics of physics
