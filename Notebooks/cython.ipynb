      "Thus it can be seen that merely by writing the code in Cython we see a order of magnitude difference in the speed. Honestly speaking, the code in python has been written terribly to show the speed difference. A vectorised code in python will also be very fast. I leave it for the readers to check! Corresponding codes can be accessed [here](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/compPhy/tree/master/Notebooks/codes/cython/prange-test). Moreover, we wrote the same thing in pure C and, to our amazement, cython is as fast as the C code! "

In some cases, though, we may need to write some performance critical part of the code in C/C++. Cython comes very handy in this case as well to act as an inerface between python and C. So our code has three layers now. The uppermost layer is in python which is extremely human readable and third layer is C while Cython is the sandwiched layer 2 between them. We will see this in the next section. This is recommended as lots of people have acknowledged that python enevironment increases their productivity given the amount of time taken in writing and debugging is very small in python. Also, personally, I believe that writing code in high level language like python is fun - u can import almost anything and do what you want! \n",
